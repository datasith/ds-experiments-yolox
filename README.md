# Object Detection with YOLOx

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and install `requirements.txt` in a `Python>=3.7.0` environment, 
including `PyTorch>=1.7`. The models and datasets download automatically from the
latest YOLOx release.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX
cd YOLOX
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, use the links provided below to open them in Google Colab.

## Training on Custom Data

All the notebooks in this repo make use of the @Megvii-BaseDetection scripts for training 
YOLOx models on custom data.

## Datasets

I'm using a few datasets to train on. This list will be updated with each added one.

- COTS (coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish [COTS])
